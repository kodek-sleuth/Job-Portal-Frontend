        <h5>By Odong Gilbert, Code Ville Writer</h5>
            <p>So you've had a crazy day, with a million deadlines 
            and a thousand small crises. Now you have to interview 
            candidates for a marketing assistant position. If you 
            don't have a human resources department to guide you 
            along, here are some tips for how to prepare for and 
            conduct a job interview -- from the other side of the 
            desk.</p>
        
        <h5 style="padding-top: 1em">Six Tips for Interviewers</h5>
            <p>Remember that during the interview process,
            candidates are deciding whether they want to work
                for you just as much as you are trying to decide
                whether to hire them. You have only about an hour 
                to make a good impression on the candidate. Follow
                these steps:</p>
            
        <h5 style="padding-top: 2em">1. Write down a list of questions that directly 
            relate to the job's responsibilities.</h5>
            <p>"If you don't have a job description, list the key 
            responsibilities of the position, and then draw up a 
            list of questions that relate to those responsibilities," 
            says John Dooney, manager of strategic resource for the
            Society for Human Resources Management, a nonprofit 
            association for human resources professionals.</p>
        
        <h5>2. Ask behavioural questions,</h5>
            <p> as in "tell me about a time when you..." 
                Ask for specific examples of past performance 
                and behaviour, says Dooney. Previous successes are a 
                good indicator of future performance.</p>
            
        <h5>3. Review the candidate's resume before the interview.</h5>
            <p>This may seem obvious, but by preparing your interview 
                questions and reviewing the resume, you are showing the 
                candidate you have taken the time to ensure a productive 
                interview.</p>
        
        <h5>4. Outline the interview structure for the candidate.</h5>
            <p> First, give a brief description of the company, and 
                then outline the job duties. Finally, ask the applicant 
                questions. After that, the candidate will have the
                opportunity to ask you questions. This sets up the
                    parameters of the interview, keeps you both focused, 
                    and gives the candidate an idea of what to expect.</p>

        <h5>5. Don't talk too much during the interview process.</h5>
                    <p> Dooney suggests hiring managers should talk only 
                    about 30 percent of the time. Allow candidates time 
                    to describe their skills and qualifications during
                    the interview. "Make sure you've covered all your
                        questions and you haven't missed anything," Dooney adds.</p>
        
        <h5>6. Extend professional courtesies, says Dooney.</h5>
            <p> Offer candidates a glass of water, and ask if they had
                    difficulty finding the place. Be on time. Consider giving
                        them a tour of the office. Give them an opportunity to 
                        speak with other team members or prospective coworkers, 
                        if appropriate.</p>
